            When looking at American fashion, it's more of a modern minimlaistic trend that derives soft fabric taht is both functional and stylish. The pictures below are directlt dervied from Adidas x Kanye West's Yeezy collection. The motivation behind this style was inspired by workers and travelers. Kanye stated that this collection provides comfort and modern style for everyoen involved in the fashion buissness.

        <p> 
            When looking at African Fashion you can clealry see the difference compared to other cultures. The African culture tries to incorporate dye into their clothing, and they also really love patterns in order to represent theor tribal values and their personality. But majority of African clothinf is hand stiched by the sellers themselves. Just like American fashion, African fashion focuses on comfort and functionality, but at the same time promoting native style.

        <p> 
            When looking ta the american culture I dont think of American as  country or a nation, I see a westernized and modern form of society that takes tradition and modernizes it. I feel that everything in the American Culture revolves around 1st world countries that are developed and keep on innovating and learning new patterns formed in our daily lives. In developed countries I feel that religion has started to dissapear and society in the 1st world has formed a new religion, Scientology. I also feel as we develop in the 1st world we begin to see Mega Cities emerging which causes us to destroy nature and overuse certain resources
