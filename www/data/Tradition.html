            "When looking ta the american culture I dont think of American as  country or a nation, I see a westernized and modern form of society that takes tradition and modernizes it. I feel that everything in the American Culture revolves around 1st world countries that are developed and keep on innovating and learning new patterns formed in our daily lives. In developed countries I feel that religion has started to dissapear and society in the 1st world has formed a new religion, Scientology. I also feel as we develop in the 1st world we begin to see Mega Cities emerging which causes us to destroy nature and overuse certain resources" - Aaliyah Thawer

            "African tradition is one that always attaches its history to evry step of development that goes on in our daily lives. But during the early days most africans were hunters and gatherers but some tribes aroud central africa still remain that way. Most women who have past the age of 65 years and above still try to provide for their familes by sewing fabric and creating household resources from natural sources, e.g. Baskets, Bracelets, e.t.c." - Zainab Suleman

            "When looking at Indian tradition there are a bunch of laws that differenciat men and women rights, these laws are usually their to emphasize on a woman's femininity and a man's masculinity. Besides that the Indian tradition is one that is packed with religion, fesitvites and symbolization on their beliefs. " - Nusrat Makhani
